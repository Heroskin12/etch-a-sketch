# etch-a-sketch
An etch-a-sketch web app.

The application supports drawing in grids between sizes 2x2 - 100x100.
The user has the ability to change the background color of the canvas, in addition to the color of the brush.
Multiple colors can be used at one time.
There is an eraser to erase one square at a time or an option to clear the whole grid.
A challenge mode has also been created. The user can time themselves to see how long it takes them to color in an entire 30x30 grid.
I intend to add further support for the challenge mode. Ideas I have include a difficulty setting, leaderboards and user accounts.
I also intend to improve the colors and overall appearance of the site.

Thank you for looking at my project.
